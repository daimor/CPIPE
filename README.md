This is a tiny example of how to run a server command from within Cach√© / Ensemble / IRIS 
and get back the full output as seen in any server command shell. 
Instead of just displaying the result the more useful purpose is to take the interesting lines 
and just skip the rest. 
It's definitely easier than $ZF(-1,..) and $ZF(-2,...) exercises.
